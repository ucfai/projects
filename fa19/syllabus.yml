      Welcome to the data science group! In this meeting, we will dive right in and immediately get
      all members into a group based on project interests. In addition, group leaders will be assigned, 
      and coordinators will facilitate narrowing down of projects. Get comfortable, as these will be your
      teammates as you spend the semester tearing apart dataset after dataset!

    title: "Using Machine Learning and Data Science to Understand the Titanic Disaster"

      The titanic dataset is often considered the "hello world" of data science. In this workshop, we will
      use this relatively simple dataset to help get you comfortable with the kind of workflow that will be 
      used in the data science group. By the end of this workshop, all groups will be comfortable with the 
      end-to-end process of data analysis, model selection, model fitting, and finally submission to kaggle.
      As always, you will have the opporunity to compete with the other groups!
