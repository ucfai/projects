      Welcome to the Data Science group! In this meeting, we will dive right in
      and immediately get all members into a group based on project interests.
      In addition, group leaders will be assigned, and coordinators will
      facilitate narrowing down of projects. Get comfortable, as these will be
      your teammates as you spend the semester tearing apart dataset after
      dataset!

      The titanic dataset is often considered the "hello world" of data science.
      In this workshop, we will use this relatively simple dataset to help get
      you comfortable with the kind of workflow that will be used in the data
      science group. By the end of this workshop, all groups will be comfortable
      with the end-to-end process of data analysis, model selection, model
      fitting, and finally submission to kaggle. As always, you will have the
      opporunity to compete with the other groups!

      Perhaps the most common and popular application of data science is in the
      financial world. For years, loan providers have had to work on intuition
      (and perhaps intellegence of underemployed math majors) to determine who
      should and should not be recieving a loan. But now days, we can use fancy
      statistics and machine learning to determine who will default on a loan.

      the loan grading of creditors line up with what reality shows? Use machine
      learning to find out!

      AI@UCF has started its first data science competition! The National Football League's 
      $75,000 competition challenges you with using player stats, position, and time data
      to predict the future number of yards gained. Come join us as we dive into this competition
      and learn how to get started.

      and other work they have been doing over the semester. We will use this
      time to catch up on concepts, help each other with issues, and share new
      ideas.

      We'll be taking a dive into the Data Science Bowl from Kaggle, live-coding
      style. Let's work through the dataset together and see what we can pull from
      it to make some submissions.

      This week we'll dig deeper into the encoding scheme of the data and developing 
      an understanding of the flow of information so we can work towards building a time-series model.
