      Welcome to the data science group! In this meeting, we will dive right in
      and immediately get all members into a group based on project interests.
      In addition, group leaders will be assigned, and coordinators will
      facilitate narrowing down of projects. Get comfortable, as these will be
      your teammates as you spend the semester tearing apart dataset after
      dataset!

      The titanic dataset is often considered the "hello world" of data science.
      In this workshop, we will use this relatively simple dataset to help get
      you comfortable with the kind of workflow that will be used in the data
      science group. By the end of this workshop, all groups will be comfortable
      with the end-to-end process of data analysis, model selection, model
      fitting, and finally submission to kaggle. As always, you will have the
      opporunity to compete with the other groups!

      Perhaps the most common and popular application of data science is in the
      financial world. For years, loan providers have had to work on intuition
      (and perhaps intellegence of underemployed math majors) to determine who
      should and should not be recieving a loan. But now days, we can use fancy
      statistics and machine learning to determine who will default on a loan.

      We continue our deep dive into the wonderful world of loan defaults. Does
      the loan grading of creditors line up with what reality shows? Use machine
      learning to find out!
